# Sentiment Analysis using BERT and Multi-instance learning

This repo contains the code and results of the research project: *Sentiment Analysis using BERT and Multi-instance learning*.

### Description:
The idea of this project is to develop a domain specific sentiment analysis model to predict sentence-level sentiment on social media comments on organic food products. For this purpose, a neural network is pre-trained on BERT sentence features and fine-tuned on our own Annotated Organic Dataset. Also, we explore the task in a cross-lingual setting using different multilingual embeddings for the data.
